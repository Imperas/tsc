**a Series of LF Projects, LLC**

---

**Adopted April 29, 2020 (v2.1)**

This charter (the "Charter") sets forth the responsibilities and procedures for technical contribution to, and oversight of, the CHIPS Alliance Project, which has been established as CHIPS Alliance Project, a Series of LF Projects, LLC (the "Project"). LF Projects, LLC ("LF Projects") is a Delaware series limited liability company. The manager of the LF Projects, LLC is the LF Projects Manager (hereafter "LF Projects Manager"). The series manager of the Project, as described in the Series Agreement for the Project is the Series Manager (hereafter "Series Manager"). All Contributors to the Project must comply with the terms of this Charter.

### 1. Mission and Scope of the Project

a. The mission of the Project is to develop and host open source projects (the "Subprojects") with the goals indicated in the "README" file within the Project's code repository.

b. The scope of the Project includes hardware and software design and development under an open source license supporting the mission, including the development of CHIPS Alliance IP Cores comprised of any and all of the following: RISC-V compute cores, accelerators, SOC buses, networks on chip and related software and documentation.

### 2. Technical Steering Committee

a. The Technical Steering Committee (the "TSC") will be responsible for all technical oversight of the open source Project.

b. Subprojects with similar characteristics will be organized into Workgroups, each of which will operate under a Workgroup charter approved by the TSC. Each Subproject's Committers will choose one representative from among themselves to lead the development process and to represent the Subproject in Workgroup activities. Each Workgroup will be responsible for drafting and updating the Workgroup charter, based upon a template charter to be approved by the TSC. Each Workgroup will elect a chair (the "Workgroup Chair") from among its representatives to coordinate Workgroup activity and to represent the Workgroup on the TSC.

c. The TSC voting members are initially the Workgroup Chairs. At the inception of the project, the Workgroup Chairs will be as set forth within the "CONTRIBUTING" file within the CHIPS Alliance's code repository. The TSC may choose an alternative approach for determining the voting members of the TSC, and any such alternative approach will be documented in the CONTRIBUTING file. Any meetings of the Technical Steering Committee are intended to be open to the public, and can be conducted electronically, via teleconference, or in person.

d. Subprojects generally will involve Contributors and Committers. The TSC may adopt or modify roles so long as the roles are documented in the CONTRIBUTING file. Unless otherwise documented:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i. Contributors include anyone in the technical community that contributes code, documentation, or other technical artifacts to the Project;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ii. Committers are Contributors who have earned the ability to modify ("commit") source code, documentation or other technical artifacts in a project's repository; and

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iii. A Contributor may become a Committer by a majority approval of the existing Committers. A Committer may be removed by a majority approval of the other existing Committers.

e. Each Contributor and Committer shall abide and be bound by the terms of this Charter.

f. The TSC may (1) establish work flow procedures for the submission, approval, and closure/archiving of Subprojects, (2) set requirements for the promotion of Contributors to Committer status, as applicable, and (3) amend, adjust, refine and/or eliminate the roles of Contributors, and Committers, and create new roles, and publicly document any TSC roles, as it sees fit.

g. The TSC may elect a TSC Chair, who will preside over meetings of the TSC and will serve until their resignation or replacement by the TSC. The TSC Chair, or any other TSC member so designated by the TSC, will serve as the primary communication contact between the Project and the CHIPS Alliance Fund of The Linux Foundation (the "CHIPS Alliance Fund").

h. Responsibilities: The TSC will be responsible for all aspects of oversight relating to the Project, which may include:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i. coordinating the technical direction of the Project;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ii. approving Workgroup or Subproject proposals (including, but not limited to, incubation, deprecation, and changes to a Subproject's scope);

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iii. organizing Subprojects into Workgroups, and removing Subprojects and Workgroups;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iv. creating sub-committees or working groups to focus on technical issues and requirements that involve multiple Workgroups;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; v. appointing representatives to work with other open source or open standards communities;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vi. establishment of any specification of the Project (each, a "Specification") proposed to Governing Board for approval as Released and then Final Specification and all interim versions of specifications;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vii. establishing community norms, workflows, issuing releases,  and security issue reporting policies;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; viii. approving and implementing policies and processes for contributing (to be published in the CONTRIBUTING file) and coordinating with the Series Manager to resolve matters or concerns that may arise as set forth in Section 7 of this Charter;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ix. discussions, seeking consensus, and where necessary, voting on technical matters relating to the code base that affect multiple Subprojects; and

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x. coordinating any marketing, events, or communications regarding the Project with the LF Projects Manager or their designee.

### 3. TSC Voting

a. While the Project aims to operate as a consensus-based community, if any TSC decision requires a vote to move the Project forward, the voting members of the TSC will vote on a one vote per voting member basis.

b. Quorum for TSC meetings requires at least fifty percent of all voting members of the TSC to be present. The TSC may continue to meet if quorum is not met, but will be prevented from making any decisions at the meeting.

c. Except as provided in Section 7.c. and 8.a, decisions by vote at a meeting require a majority vote of those in attendance, provided quorum is met. Decisions made by electronic vote without a meeting require a majority vote of all voting members of the TSC.
